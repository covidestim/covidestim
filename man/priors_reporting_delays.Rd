\title{Fixed distributions on reporting delays}
\usage{
priors_reporting_delays(
  cas_rep_delay = c(2.2, 1 * 7),
  die_rep_delay = c(2.2, 1 * 7)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cas_rep_delay}{A two-element numeric vector containing the mean shape
and rate for a gamma distribution describing the delay (in days) in case
reporting.  Shape and rate are parameterized with a lognormal prior where
the log of the input value is the median and the variance is 0.5. Based on
average delay reported in Santa Clara County, CA on 8 April 2020.}

\item{die_rep_delay}{A two-element numeric vector containing the mean shape
and rate for a gamma distribution describing delay (in days) in death
reporting.  Shape and rate are parameterized with a lognormal prior where
the log of the input value is the median and the variance is 0.5. Based on
average delay reported in Santa Clara County, CA on 8 April 2020.}

\value{
An S3 object of class 'priors'
}
\description{
This function returns a keyed list of mean values for the gamma distribution
of delays related reporting of cases and deaths.  Called with no arguments,
the default values are returned. Custom hyperpriors can be specified by
passing values for the parameters specified below. The return value of this
function must be added to a \code{covidestim} object using the addition
operator (see examples).
}
\examples{
# If you believe that cases are generally reported one day after the date of
# the test, and deaths one day after the event:
cfg <- covidestim(ndays = 120, region = '09009', pop_size=get_pop('09009')) +
  priors_reporting_delays(
    cas_rep_delay = c(2.7, 3), # Mean = ~1 day
    die_rep_delay = c(2.7, 3)  # Mean = ~1 day
  )
