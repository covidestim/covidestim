Description: covidestim is a Bayesian nowcasting approach that explicitly
  accounts for reporting delays and secular changes in case ascertainment to
  generate real-time estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology on the basis of reported
  cases and deaths. Using this approach, we can estimate time trends in
  infections, symptomatic cases, and deaths for all 50 US states and the District
  of Columbia from early-March 2020 through the present. The covidestim package
  contains all you need to reproduce our work, but itâ€™s really targeted at users
  who want to try running our model on their own state- or county-level data.
